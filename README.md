**Why Learn React Native?**

React Native is a powerful framework for building mobile applications that offers several advantages:

1. **Cross-Platform Development**: Write once, run anywhere. With React Native, you can develop applications for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase, saving time and effort.
2. **Performance**: React Native provides near-native performance by leveraging native components, which means your app will run smoothly and efficiently on mobile devices.
3. **Rich Ecosystem**: The React Native ecosystem includes a vast array of libraries, tools, and community resources that can accelerate development and solve common challenges.
4. **Hot Reloading**: This feature allows developers to instantly see the results of the latest changes without needing to recompile the entire application, which speeds up the development process.
5. **Component-Based Architecture**: React Native's component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability of code, making it easier to manage and scale applications.
6. **Strong Community Support**: Being backed by Facebook and a large open-source community, React Native has extensive documentation, tutorials, and community support, making it easier to find solutions and stay updated with best practices.

**What is React Native?**

React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that enables developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows for the creation of natively rendered mobile apps by using a combination of JavaScript and native code. React Native bridges the gap between web and mobile app development, enabling the reuse of code across platforms and providing a native-like experience for users.

Key features include:

- **Native Components**: React Native provides access to native mobile components, such as buttons and text inputs, which render directly on the device.
- **Declarative UI**: Using React’s declarative approach, developers can describe how the UI should look for various states, and React Native takes care of updating the view.
- **Reusable Components**: React Native promotes the creation of reusable components, improving efficiency and consistency in the development process.

**What Can Be Done Using React Native?**

With React Native, you can develop a wide range of mobile applications, including:

1. **Social Media Apps**: Build platforms similar to Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.
1. **E-Commerce Apps**: Develop shopping apps with functionalities like product listings, cart management, and payment processing.
1. **Entertainment Apps**: Create apps for streaming services, news, and media consumption.
1. **Productivity Apps**: Develop tools for task management, calendar scheduling, and document editing.
1. **Health and Fitness Apps**: Build applications for tracking workouts, health metrics, and diet plans.
1. **Educational Apps**: Create platforms for learning and online courses with interactive content.

**Average Salary**

**India:**

- **Entry-Level React Native Developer**: ₹4,00,000 - ₹7,00,000 per annum
- **Mid-Level React Native Developer**: ₹7,00,000 - ₹12,00,000 per annum
